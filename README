A python wrapper for the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning program.
More on Vowpal Wabbit at (https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki).

Requires:
- Python >= 2.4 (for the subprocess module).
- The vw executable (from the main VW website).

Basic usage of the module:
- Create VowpalRecord objects for both the training and test set.
- Create a new Vowpal object and pass the records to the predict method.
- Receive predictions as a return value.

You can find an example at the bottom of the vowpal.py module.

TODO:
- Support streaming of record objects so that the entire dataset doesn't
need to be in memory.
